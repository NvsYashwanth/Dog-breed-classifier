This is a repo for the Dog Breed Classifier Project in Udacity Nanodegree. It is implemented using PyTorch library.

**Udacity's original repo is [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-dog-classification)**



## Project Overview

Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will  identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a  human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
